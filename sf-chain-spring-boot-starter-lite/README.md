# SF-Chain Starter Lite

`sf-chain-spring-boot-starter-lite` provides SF-Chain core runtime without forcing web/JPA/JDBC/database driver dependencies into consumer projects.

Use this starter when you only need:
- `@AIOp`
- `BaseAIOperation`
- `AIService`
- model dispatch and operation execution

Management API, static UI, and local persistence are feature-gated and disabled by default.
